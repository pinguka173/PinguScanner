🛑 TERMS OF SERVICE — PinguScanner

Effective Date: 04-05-2025.
1. 👁️ FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY

PinguScanner (hereafter “The Software”) is intended solely for educational, research, and lawful diagnostic purposes. You agree to only use this software on systems and networks you own, have explicit permission to scan, or operate in a legal lab environment.

If you use this for anything else, congratulations: you're a criminal, and you’ve just volunteered to be the star of the next FBI training slideshow. If you ignore this and point it at federal infrastructure, that’s 100% on you. The developer bear no responsibility for your actions, your court date, or your cellmate. But I'll pray for you.
2. 🧠 NO LIABILITY

The author(s) of this software bear zero responsibility for any damage, disruption, or pants-shitting federal charges resulting from its use. That includes (but is not limited to):

    Denial of service

    Unauthorized access

    Legal action from governments, companies, or pissed-off sysadmins

    National security breaches (looking at you, little script kiddie)

Basically: you fuck around, you find out. Not my problem.
3. 📜 YOU BREAK IT, YOU BOUGHT IT

By using this software, you agree that:

    You’re not a dumbass (or at least, not dumb enough to misuse this).

    You understand that port scanning can trigger alarms, bans, blacklists, or legal escalation.

    You’ll never scan without consent or try to weaponize this.

4. ⚖️ EXPORT LAWS & RESTRICTIONS

Don’t use or export this software into countries under U.S. embargo, or to anyone on terrorist watchlists. If you do, I didn’t see shit, I don’t know shit, and you’re on your own. Although that's already the case.
5. 🛑 TERMINATION CLAUSE

If you violate these terms or act like a complete jackass, your permission to use this tool is revoked immediately. I will not send help. In fact, I will laugh.
6. 🧾 FINAL NOTE

This is a tool, not a toy. If your first instinct is to scan random government domains or “see if it works on NASA,” please uninstall this, go outside, and rethink your life or touch grass.

Use responsibly—or get real fucking familiar with your local cybercrime unit.
